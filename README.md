## Overview

### The challenge

Create the UI design and the website should operate as required: 
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
- axios


### Useful resources

- [react-tabs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tabs) - This helped me easily create tabs. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [Resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand.
